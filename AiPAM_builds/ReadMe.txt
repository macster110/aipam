#Running the aipam.jar file

If using Windows simply download the .exe file and double click to open. 

Alternatively

runAiPam.bat is a bat file that will run the jar file with the correct vm argumnets

You must have java 8 installed for this to work, ideally version 131. You may need to change "set path"
in the .bar file to your java 8 jre or jdk folder. To do this open the file in notepad, change the path, 
save and then double click the file again
